Carmon's fullstack boilerplate
==============================

> It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.

This is general purpose boilerplate, to kickstart a JS app with a minimal client & server side. 
The stack is nodemon running express-js in the server, and a webpack dev server running reactjs 
with hot module reloading in the client. To take a quick look at the bolierplate you can run 
`npm run publish` command, but concurrently will not work with hot module reload, ideally you 
should run `npm run client` and `npm run server` in 2 different terminals. Do not use this in
production, it's just a kickstart repository for quick prototypes. 

So long.
